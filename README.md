# kindle-note-bud

The Kindle tends to save one's notes in a chronological fashion(In the 'My Clippings.txt' file). If one's in the habit of reading multiple books, it can be a bit of a pain to sort the notes by book name(Especially if you take lots of notes).

This script quickly sorts the notes for you.

If you do intend to use this, know that this script is designed for Linux(i.e Directory structure). It's best if you look at the My Clippings.txt file before you try to run this, it will give you a better understanding of what the script intends to do.
