# kindle-note-bud

The Kindle tends to save one's notes in a chronological fashion(In the 'My Clippings.txt' file). If one's in the habit of reading multiple books, it can be a bit of a pain to sort the notes by book name(Especially if you take lotsa notes).

This script quickly sorts the notes for you.
